  - Hello Bungus
  - Oh, are you looking for Grub?
  - He's in the back room on the door to your right.
  - I ususally don't let customers go back there, but he just rushed in there without
    saying anything and locked the door behind him.
  - Anyway, I'll let you go back there if you can find the key.
  - I lost the key somewhere in the storage room while I was moving some boxes around.
    If you manage to find it for me, I'll let you use it enter the back room.
  - The storage room is beyond the door on the far wall to your left. Good luck!
