  - BUNGUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  - HOW HAVE YOU BEEN MY BROTHER! IT IS SO GOOD TO SEE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!
  - I have been waiting for you - take a seat. I have much to share...
  - Maybe you suspect why I am here.
  - Mungodongus Frogbert is comming for us toads. He is making us slaves to his corporate
    empire. He is keeping us as if we are rats. The conditions are beyond the law.
    But I suppose the law does not apply to us toads.
  - I - WE - must stop him.
  - The Bog is drying up due to his madness and us toads and even you frogs are are
    suffering and dying. So, I propose an idea.
  - I say we get together members of the community and stage a rally infront of Frogbert
    Industries while Mungodonus is inside.
  - Any form of retaliation will be met with force. Peacful protest has failed us...
  - I found a secret enterance into the building of which I will use to sneak inside.
  - Once I am inside - I will find that wretch Mungodongus and send him back to hell.
  - I know it sounds crazy my freind. But please think about it... for the Bog.
